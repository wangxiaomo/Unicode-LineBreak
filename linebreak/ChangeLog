	* Fix: linebreak_break_partial(): Memory leak saving status.
	* Fix: linebreak_break_partial(): Fix state transition.
	* Fix: gcstring_cmp(): Case of comparison with zero length string.
	* New: linebreak_break() and linebreak_break_fast().  Latter consumes
	  heap size proportional to length of input.  lenebreak_break() is
	  highly recommended.
	* Chg: linebreak_break*() get unistr_t * input than return unistr_t *.
	* break.c: Cleanup codes.
