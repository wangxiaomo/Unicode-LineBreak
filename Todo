	* ``Hunging punctuation'' (ぶら下げ組み; burasage-gumi) mainly for
	  Japanese texts.

	- Punctuations may protrude into the right -- bottom, in vertical
	  line -- margin.
	- It is usually applied to IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP and
	  IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA.  It is rarely applied to FULL STOP and COMMA.
	- ``Half-''hunging, regarding ideographic punctuations as narrow
	  only at end of line, might be either allowed or inhibited by
	  typesetting rules, whether (full-)hunging was allowed or not.
	- I. FULL STOP is more often inhibited to be narrow than I. COMMA.
	- Wide (including fullwidth) parentheses may or may not
	  ``half''-hung by rules, however, they shouldn't ``full''-hung
	  anyway.
